A WAN is a network infrastructure that spans a wide geographical area. WANs are typically managed by service providers (SPs) or Internet Service Providers (ISPs).

WANs have specific characteristics:

-   WANs interconnect [[LAN]]s over wide geographical areas such as between cities, states, provinces, countries, or continents.
-   WANs are usually administered by multiple service providers.
-   WANs typically provide slower speed links between LANs.
