Networks come in all sizes. They range from simple networks consisting of two computers, to networks connecting millions of devices.

Simple home networks let you share resources, such as printers, documents, pictures, and music, among a few local end devices.

Small office and home office (SOHO) networks allow people to work from home, or a remote office. Many self-employed workers use these types of networks to advertise and sell products, order supplies, and communicate with customers.

Businesses and large organizations use networks to provide consolidation, storage, and access to information on network servers. Networks provide email, instant messaging, and collaboration among employees. Many organizations use their network’s connection to the internet to provide products and services to customers.

The internet is the largest network in existence. In fact, the term internet means a “network of networks”. It is a collection of interconnected private and public networks.

Network infrastructures vary greatly in terms of:

-   Size of the area covered
-   Number of users connected
-   Number and types of services available
-   Area of responsibility

The two most common types of network infrastructures are Local Area Networks ([[LAN]]s), and Wide Area Networks ([[WAN]]s). A [[LAN]] is a network infrastructure that provides access to users and end devices in a small geographical area. A [[LAN]] is typically used in a department within an enterprise, a home, or a small business network. A [[WAN]] is a network infrastructure that provides access to other networks over a wide geographical area, which is typically owned and managed by a larger corporation or a telecommunications service provider. This picture shows [[LAN]]s connected to a [[WAN]].
