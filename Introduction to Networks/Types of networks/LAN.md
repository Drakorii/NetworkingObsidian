A LAN is a network infrastructure that spans a small geographical area. LANs have specific characteristics:

-   LANs interconnect [[end-device]]s in a limited area such as a home, school, office building, or campus.
-   A LAN is usually administered by a single organization or individual. Administrative control is enforced at the network level and governs the security and access control policies.
-   LANs provide high-speed bandwidth to internal end devices and [[intermediary devices]].
