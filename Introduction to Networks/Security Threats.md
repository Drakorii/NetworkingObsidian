There are several common external threats to networks:
-   **Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses** - These contain malicious software or code running on a user device.
-   **Spyware and adware** - These are types of software which are installed on a user’s device. The software then secretly collects information about the user.
-   **Zero-day attacks** - Also called zero-hour attacks, these occur on the first day that a vulnerability becomes known.
-   **Threat actor attacks** - A malicious person attacks user devices or network resources.
-   **Denial of service attacks** - These attacks slow or crash applications and processes on a network device.
-   **Data interception and theft** - This attack captures private information from an organization’s network.
-   **Identity theft** - This attack steals the login credentials of a user in order to access private data.

It is equally important to consider internal threats. There have been many studies that show that the most common data breaches happen because of internal users of the network. This can be attributed to lost or stolen devices, accidental misuse by employees, and in the business environment, even malicious employees. With the evolving BYOD strategies, corporate data is much more vulnerable. Therefore, when developing a security policy, it is important to address both external and internal security threats.
