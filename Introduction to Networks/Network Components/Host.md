There are multiple types of hosts. The term host specifically refers to devices that are assigned a number for communication purposes. This number is called an [[IP Address]]. 
The [[IP Address]] identifies hosts within a particular network. 
It can be used to find out which network a specific host is attached to.

Types of hosts:
- [[Client]]
- [[Server]]
- [[End-Device]]
- [[Intermediary Devices]]
