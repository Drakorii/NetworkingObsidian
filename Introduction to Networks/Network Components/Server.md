Servers are computers with software that allow them to provide information, like email or web pages, to other end devices on the network. 

Each service requires separate server software. For example, a server requires web server software in order to provide web services to the network. A computer with server software can provide services simultaneously to many different [[Client]]s.

You can find examples for server software at [[Client and Server Software]]
