The network devices that people are most familiar with are end devices. 
To distinguish one end-device from another, each end-device on a network has an address. When an end device initiates communication, it uses the address of the destination end-device to specify where to deliver the message.

An end-device is either the source or destination of a message transmitted over the network.
In this example you can see multiple end-devices connected within their and another network.
