[[Client and Server Software]] usually run on separate computers, but it is also possible for one computer to be used for both roles at the same time. In small businesses and homes, many computers function as the servers and clients on the network. This type of network is called a peer-to-peer network.

In this example, the print sharing PC has a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection to the printer and a [[Network Connection]], using a network interface card (NIC), to the file sharing PC.

Advantages of peer-to-peer networking:
- Easy to set up
- Less complex
- Lower cost because network devices and dedicated servers may not be required
- Can be used for simple tasks such as transferring files and sharing a printer

Disadvantages of peer-to-peer networking:
- No centrilized administration
- Not as secure
- Not scaleable
- All devices may act as both clients and servers which can slow their performance
