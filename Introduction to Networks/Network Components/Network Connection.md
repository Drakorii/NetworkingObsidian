Communication transmits across a network on media. The media provides the channel over which the message travels from source to destination.

Modern networks primarily use three types of media to interconnect devices:
-   Metal wires within cables
Data is encoded into electrical impulses.
-   Glass or plastic fibers within cables (fiber-optic cable)
Data is encoded into pulses of light.
-  Wireless transmission 
Data is encoded via modulation of specific frequencies of electromagnetic waves.

The four main criteria for choosing nework media are:
1. What is the maximum distance that the media can successfully carry a signal?
2. What is the environment in which the media will be installed?
3. What is the amount of data and at what speed must it be transmitted?
4. What is the cost of the media and installation?


Here are images of how the cables look like irl:
