All computers that are connected to a network and participate directly in network communication are classified as [[Host]] . 

Network architects and administrators must be able to show what their networks will look like. They need to be able to easily see which components connect to other components, where they will be located, and how they will be connected.
Diagrams of networks often use symbols to represent the different devices and connections that make up a network.

The Symbols used in this documentation are the ones from the "Cisco Packet Tracer" software:

A diagram provides an easy way to understand how devices connect in a large network. 
This type of “picture” of a network is known as a [[Network Topology]] diagram. The ability to recognize the logical representations of the physical networking components is critical to being able to visualize the organization and operation of a network.

In addition to these representations, specialized terminology is used to describe how each of these devices and media connect to each other:

-   **Network Interface Card (NIC)** - A NIC physically connects the end device to the network.
-   **Physical Port** - A connector or outlet on a networking device where the media connects to an end device or another networking device.
-   **Interface** - Specialized ports on a networking device that connect to individual networks. Because routers connect networks, the ports on a router are referred to as network interfaces.

**Note**: The terms port and interface are often used for the same thing.
