These are the basic security components for a home or small office network:
-   **Antivirus and antispyware** - These applications help to protect end devices from becoming infected with malicious software.
-   **Firewall filtering** - Firewall filtering blocks unauthorized access into and out of the network. This may include a host-based firewall system that prevents unauthorized access to the end device, or a basic filtering service on the home router to prevent unauthorized access from the outside world into the network.

In contrast, the network security implementation for a corporate network usually consists of many components built into the network to monitor and filter traffic. Ideally, all components work together, which minimizes maintenance and improves security. Larger networks and corporate networks use antivirus, antispyware, and firewall filtering, but they also have other security requirements:
-   **Dedicated firewall systems** - These provide more advanced firewall capabilities that can filter large amounts of traffic with more granularity.
-   **Access control lists (ACL)** - These further filter access and traffic forwarding based on IP addresses and applications.
-   **Intrusion prevention systems (IPS)** - These identify fast-spreading threats, such as zero-day or zero-hour attacks.
-   **Virtual private networks (VPN)** - These provide secure access into an organization for remote workers.
