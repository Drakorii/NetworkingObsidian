The default name should be changed to something more descriptive. By choosing names wisely, it is easier to remember, document, and identify network devices. Here are some important naming guidelines for hosts:

-   Start with a letter
-   Contain no spaces
-   End with a letter or digit
-   Use only letters, digits, and dashes
-   Be less than 64 characters in length

To configure the hostname on any device:
Switch>**enable**
Switch#**conf t**
Switch(config)#**hostname Sw-MeetingRoom-69**
Sw-MeetingRoom-69(config)#
