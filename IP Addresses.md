# IPv4

The structure of an IPv4 address is called dotted decimal notation and is represented by four decimal numbers between 0 and 255. IPv4 addresses are assigned to individual devices connected to a network.

With the IPv4 address, a subnet mask is also necessary. An IPv4 subnet mask is a 32-bit value that differentiates the network portion of the address from the host portion. Coupled with the IPv4 address, the subnet mask determines to which subnet the device is a member.

# IPv6

IPv6 is the most recent version of IP and is replacing the more common IPv4.

IPv6 addresses are 128 bits in length and written as a string of hexadecimal values. Every four bits is represented by a single hexadecimal digit; for a total of 32 hexadecimal values. Groups of four hexadecimal digits are separated by a colon (:) . IPv6 addresses are not case-sensitive and can be written in either lowercase or uppercase.
